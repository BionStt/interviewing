The interview time is 11 a.m. to 12 noon, Pacific Time.

There will be two half-hour interviews, with two interviewers each. 

The interview focuses on real-world work, including reading/writing code,
technical communication, and how to build substantial applications.

Please come prepared to show some of your existing code,
discuss one or more of your recent relevant projects,
and write new code together with our teammates.

If you have a laptop and want to bring it, that's good.
Set it up to show your work in the way you want.

Thank you for coming in, and we look forward to meeting you.
