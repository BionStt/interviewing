# Interviewing

Interviewing for hiring is a big deal, for candidates and for employees.

This repo has notes and links that help our team with interviews.

We focus on technical interviews for software developers, because this is what we do often.

We generally recommend interviewing processes as described by [Google](https://google.com), and as championed by [Laszlo Bock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laszlo_Bock)

Example:




## 3 types of questions

From [3 types of job interview questions you should be prepared to answer at Google](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/25/3-types-of-questions-google-asks-in-a-job-interview.html)

1. Challenge question

Ask an open-end question, such as "Why was the project successful?" or "What would you do on a similar future project?"

Goal: the interviewer finds the top edges of the candiates capabilities.

Reasoning: These types of questions are complex and have a wide range of answers, so the interviewer can learn about the candidate's thought process. The interviewer may push back on some of the candidate's responses, to see how the candidate responds and position.


2. Insight question

Ask a specific question that involves surprises and opinions, such as "What surprises you about â€¦?" or "What is a perspective that you have, that is different from most people?"

Goal: the interviewer discovers what insights the candidate gained from previous positions.

Reasoning: The framing is meant to encourage insightful thought and discussion, and to get away from a candidate providing rehearsed answers. The purpose is to help the candidate think from a unique perspective.


3. Scenario question

Ask a project-oriented team-oriented question, such as "How do you work as a team on projects, to plan them and build them?" or "When you need to make an important decision, how do you do it?"

Goal: the interviewer learns how the candidate works on a team.

Reasoning: The framing is meant to encourage discussion of teamwork, planning, and long term work together.
